# Sales Data Preprocessing

This repository contains a comprehensive pipeline for preprocessing sales data, including handling missing values, outliers, feature scaling, and train-test splitting. Below is a brief overview of each preprocessing step:

## 1. Handling Missing Values
Missing data is addressed by either filling in missing entries with relevant statistics (mean, median) or by removing records where appropriate. This ensures the dataset is complete and ready for analysis without introducing bias.

## 2. Outlier Detection and Removal
Outliers are identified using statistical methods like the Z-score or IQR. These anomalies are removed or adjusted to prevent them from skewing the results, ensuring a more robust model.

## 3. Feature Scaling
Feature scaling is applied to normalize the data, bringing all features to a comparable scale. This step is crucial for algorithms sensitive to the magnitude of data, like SVMs and neural networks.

## 4. Train-Test Split
The dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance. Typically, 80% of the data is used for training, and 20% for testing, ensuring the model's ability to generalize to unseen data.

## Getting Started
To run the preprocessing pipeline, clone the repository and follow the instructions provided in the Jupyter Notebook.
